<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  The BACnet I/P data source is used to gather data from BACnet I/P compatible devices accessible over an I/P network. 
  Equipment can be in a local network or intranet, or could also be anywhere in the internet. This data source uses both 
  polling and COV (Change Of Value) subscriptions for updating as applicable.
</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>
  Every data source requires a <b>Name</b>, which can be any description. The <b>Update period</b> determines how often 
  the BACnet equipment is polled for data. Polling is only used if a desired object does not support COV subscriptions. 
  The device is automatically queried for its supported services to make this determination.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Device ID</b> is the identifier that Mango will provide to other equipment in its IAm message. An IAm message 
  is automatically sent upon startup of the data source to declare its presence to the network, and is also sent in 
  response to appropriate WhoIs requests.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Broadcast address</b> is the IP address for broadcast messages. Your network administrator will provide you 
  with an appropriate value to use. The <b>Port</b> is the port number upon which Mango will listen for incoming 
  messages. Note that Mango supports situations where other equipment within the BACnet network listens on other ports, 
  but broadcast messages will only be sent to the port number upon which Mango listens.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Strict device comparisons</b> setting determines if devices are compared for equality by comparing only the 
  device's address (unchecked), or if the device instance number is used (checked). This allows BACnet internetworks 
  that reuse device instance numbers (although this is not proper usage) to still operate.   
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Timeout</b>, <b>Segment timeout</b>, <b>Segment window</b>, and <b>Retries</b> values are BACnet messaging 
  attributes. In most cases the given default values should be appropriate. Consult the BACnet I/P documentation or your 
  network administrator to determine if other values should be used for your network.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>COV lease time</b> is the number of minutes that Mango will request to hold a COV lease. Mango will 
  automatically attempt to refresh its COV subscriptions after half of the given time has elapsed. So, if the least time 
  is 60 minutes, Mango will request the device honour the lease for 60 minutes, and will resubscribe after 30.
</p>
<p>
  Where COV subscriptions are not available, polling at the given rate is used instead. Devices are polled individually. 
  Devices that support ReadPropertyMultiple requests are sent this message, partitioned to contain no more than 200 
  properties in a single request if necessary. Otherwise, individual ReadProperty requests are sent.
</p>

<h1>BACnet I/P discovery</h1>
<p>
  Devices on BACnet networks can be discovered automatically by broadcasting WhoIs messages. Devices are required to 
  respond with an IAm message, which contains some basic information about the device. To test configuration settings 
  and determine what devices are available for points, enter the <b>Port</b> number to which to broadcast and click the 
  "Send WhoIs" button. (If the port number is not provided, the value from the configuration is used.) A single WhoIs 
  message will be sent, and then the device will listen for IAm messages indefinitely. (Clicking "Cancel" will stop the 
  listener.) As IAm messages are received, information about the devices will be displayed in the table below button. 
  The information can be used for the creation of points.
