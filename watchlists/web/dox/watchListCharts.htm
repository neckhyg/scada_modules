  All of the chartable numeric points in your current list can be charted together using the Chart section. Only those
  points that have their checkbox checked will be charted, and only binary, multistate, and numeric points are eligible
  for charting. You must click the <em>run</em> icon (<img src="images/control_play_blue.png"/>) to have the chart 
  appear. For performance reasons charts are not automatically refreshed; you must click the run icon to refresh it 
  manually.
