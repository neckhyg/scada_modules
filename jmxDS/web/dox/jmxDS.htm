<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  The JMX data source is used to monitor values exposed by a JMX server, either local to the instance or remote. The
  values that are available vary widely depending on the applications running in the JVM instance, but there are always
  common values, such as those associated with JVM memory.
</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>
  Every data source requires a <b>Name</b>, which can be any description. The <b>Use local JMX server</b> checkbox
  indicates whether the JMX server in the local JVM should be used. Otherwise, the <b>Remote JMX server address</b>
  can be specified.
</p>

<p>
  The <b>Update period</b> determines how often the JMX server is polled for data. Checking <b>Quantize</b> will cause 
  the data source startup to be delayed so that pollings occur at a "rounded" point in time (e.g. if polling is every 
  10 seconds, polls will occur on the 10th second, the 20th second, etc). Otherwise, polling will begin immediately.
