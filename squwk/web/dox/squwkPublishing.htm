<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  The Squwk.com publisher sends point updates (or change, as appropriate) to Squwk using the given access and secret 
  key pair. Updates are sent in batches for maximum throughput. 
</p>

<h1>Properties</h1>
<p>
  The <b>Access key</b> and <b>Secret key</b> are needed to authenticate with Squwk. You can find it in the "Account" 
  area when you log in to Squwk.com.
</p>

<h1>Published points</h1>
<p>
  The <b>Points</b> section lists the points to be published. Point publishing can be enabled 
  (<img src="images/brick_go.png"/>) or disabled (<img src="images/brick_stop.png"/>). Disabling a point allows it to 
  not be used without having to explicitly delete it. The <b>GUID</b> value determines the point that will be updated.
</p>
<p>
  To add a point to the point list, select it in the points list and click the <img src="images/icon_comp_add.png"/> 
  icon. To delete an existing point, click its associated <img src="images/bullet_delete.png"/> icon.
