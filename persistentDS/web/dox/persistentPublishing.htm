<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  The persistent TCP publisher is a highly efficient way of sending data from one Mango instance to another. It is used 
  to publish point updates, but will also automatically create and synchronize point information on the remote instance.
  Typically, remote instances will publish to a central persistent TCP data source, but other topologies are also 
  possible.
</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>
  The <b>Host</b> is the domain name or IP address of the remote system upon which there is a listening Persistent TCP
  data source listening. The <b>Port</b> is the port number at which that data source is configured to listen. The 
  <b>Authorization key</b> is the shared secret key required to have the connection request accepted.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>XID prefix</b> is a prefix for data point XID values such that they remain unique on the remote instance. For
  example, if there were two field systems with similar configurations publishing to a single central instance, data
  point XID collisions may result if the same XID values are used in the field systems. By providing a different prefix
  value in the field systems, the XIDs at the central instance can be guaranteed to be unique. Note that XID length
  constraints apply. XIDs have a maximum length of 50 characters, so if the XID in the field system has a length of, 
  say, 40 characters, the prefix can be no longer than 10 characters.
</p>
<p>
  Persistent publisher and data source combinations can be configured to synchronize their historical data by choosing 
  an appropriate value in the <b>Synchronize historical data</b> select. If, for example, the publisher is temporarily
  disabled and restarted, any data generated during the period in which it was inactive will be missing at the data
  source instance. Synchronization attempts to fill in gaps by using a "binary search"-type algorithm to find them.
</p>

<h1>Notes</h1>
<p>
  Published points are automatically created in the remote system using most of the properties of the point in the 
  field system. (Some properties are not appropriate for replication.) Changes to point properties are sent to the
  remote system for replication, although the remote system may not accept the changes if it is not configured to do so.
</p>
<p>
  If synchronization of historical data is enabled, additional point history should not be added to the point at the
  data source side since this will cause problems in the algorithm that searches for data gaps.
