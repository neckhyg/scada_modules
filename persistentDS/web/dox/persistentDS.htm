<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  This data source is used to collect data sent from persistent TCP publishers on other Mango instances. (The data 
  source is capable of receiving publisher connections from the same instance, but this is typically of little utility.)
</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>
  Every data source requires a <b>Name</b>, which can be any description. The <b>XID</b> is used in the import/export
  facility, and must be unique among all data sources. By default a value is automatically generated that is unique at 
  the time of generation.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Port</b> is the TCP port number at which the data source will listen for connection requests from publishers.
  This can be any number from 1 to 65535, but some care must be taken to choose a number that is not already in use on
  the host.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Authorization key</b> is a shared secret key between the publisher and the data source, which provides 
  security on the connection by preventing unauthorized connections to the data source.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Accept point attribute updates</b> checkbox determines whether point update requests from the publisher should
  be accepted and used. For example, if a user on the publisher system changes the name or other properties of a point
  configured in the publisher, the publisher will notify the data source of the change. If such changes are accepted
  the change will be implemented on the data source instance as well.
