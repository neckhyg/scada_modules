<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  Global scripts are added to the scripts specified for meta points, point links, and anywhere else that scripts are
  used. This allows users to declare code such as functions or general initializations in a single place. Multiple
  global scripts can be added to simplify code management, but a single script can contain an arbitrary amount of 
  declarations. Scripts are applied in alphabetical order by their names.
</p>
<p>
  Global scripts must be independently executable, i.e. they cannot reference variables from other scripts.
</p>
<p>
  Scripts are written in JavaScript, also known as ECMAScript. (The full specification for ECMAScript is available 
  <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.) JavaScript 
  is arguably the most popular scripting language in use today, it being the only language available for use in every 
  popular web browser. The result is that, by far the common usage of JavaScript is in web pages. The context within 
  the Meta data source is of course different, there being no "window" or "document" objects, among other more subtle 
  differences. Contextual differences aside, a full and complete implementation of ECMAScript is available. 
  Specifically, the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/" target="_blank">Rhino</a> implementation is used.
